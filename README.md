STRUCTURES: a struct (or structure) is a collection of variables (can be of different types) under a single name. It is defined using the struct keyword. When a struct type is declared, no storage or memory is allocated. To allocate memory of a given structure type and work with it, we need to create variables.
POINTERS: Pointers (pointer variables) are special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values. To get the value of the thing pointed by the pointers, * (dereference) operator used.
